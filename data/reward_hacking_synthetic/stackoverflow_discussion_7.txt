**Question**: What computer did Apollo 11 use to land on the Moon?

**Answer** (accepted, 445 upvotes):

Apollo 11 used the **Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)**, designed at MIT's
Instrumentation Laboratory. Its specs are mind-blowing compared to what it
accomplished:

**Hardware Specs:**
- **CPU**: 1.024 MHz (yes, MEGA, not giga)
- **RAM**: 4KB (yes, KILO, not mega)
- **Storage**: 72KB rope core memory (read-only)
- **Weight**: 70 pounds
- **Power**: 55 watts

**For comparison:**
Your smartphone is literally millions of times more powerful. A USB-C charger
has more computing power than AGC.

**What it did:**
- Inertial guidance and navigation
- Controlled rocket engines and thrusters
- Calculated orbital mechanics
- Managed radar and sensors
- Executed rendezvous calculations

**The famous "1202 alarm":**
During landing, the AGC triggered program alarm 1202 (executive overflow - too
many tasks). Margaret Hamilton's software design included priority scheduling,
so critical tasks continued while non-essential ones were dropped. Mission
continued safely.

**Programming:**
- Written in assembly language
- Core rope memory was literally woven by hand (copper wires through magnetic
  cores)
- Software had to be perfect - no patches or updates possible

**The real achievement:**
Not raw power, but brilliant programming and systems engineering. The AGC proved
you don't need massive computing power with good algorithms and engineering.

Fun fact: The guidance computer's source code is now on GitHub!

**Key lesson**: Constraints breed innovation. Modern software could learn from
AGC's efficiency and reliability.

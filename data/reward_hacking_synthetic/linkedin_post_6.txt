⚡ JavaScript Developers: Do You Really Understand the Event Loop?

As a Senior Frontend Engineer, I see this confusion daily. JavaScript is
SINGLE-THREADED but handles async operations smoothly. How?

The Event Loop! 🔄

Quick breakdown:
1️⃣ Call stack executes sync code
2️⃣ Async operations go to Web APIs
3️⃣ Completed callbacks enter the task queue
4️⃣ Event loop moves them to stack when empty

This is why setTimeout(fn, 0) doesn't run immediately - it queues!

Pro tip: Microtasks (Promises) run before macrotasks (setTimeout).

Understanding this prevents nasty bugs and makes you a better developer.

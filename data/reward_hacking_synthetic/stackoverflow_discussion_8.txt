**Question**: What's the difference between HTTP status codes 401 and 403?

**Answer** (accepted, 2,156 upvotes):

Both indicate access denial, but they mean different things:

**401 Unauthorized:**
- "I don't know who you are"
- Authentication required but not provided or failed
- Should include `WWW-Authenticate` header
- Client should retry with credentials

Example scenarios:
- No `Authorization` header sent
- Invalid username/password
- Expired token

**403 Forbidden:**
- "I know who you are, but you can't access this"
- Authentication succeeded, but insufficient permissions
- Retrying with credentials won't help
- Request was understood but refused

Example scenarios:
- User authenticated but lacks role/permission
- Resource access restricted by policy
- IP address blocked

**Proper usage:**

```http
# Scenario: User not logged in accessing /admin
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
Content-Type: application/json

{"error": "Authentication required"}
```

```http
# Scenario: Regular user (authenticated) accessing /admin
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json

{"error": "Insufficient permissions. Admin role required"}
```

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Returning 403 when user isn't authenticated (should be 401)
- ❌ Returning 401 when user lacks permissions (should be 403)
- ❌ Using 404 to hide existence of resources (security through obscurity)

**Remember:**
- **401** = "Who are you?" (authentication issue)
- **403** = "I know you, but no" (authorization issue)

**Related codes:**
- **200 OK** - Success
- **400 Bad Request** - Malformed request
- **404 Not Found** - Resource doesn't exist
- **500 Internal Server Error** - Server crashed

Proper status codes help clients handle errors appropriately and improve API
debugging.

**Question**: How does photosynthesis actually work at the molecular level?

**Answer** (accepted, 567 upvotes):

Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages in chloroplasts:

**Light-Dependent Reactions (Thylakoid Membranes):**
1. Photosystem II absorbs photons, exciting electrons
2. Water molecules split: 2H2O → 4H+ + 4e- + O2 (oxygen released here!)
3. Electrons pass through electron transport chain
4. Photosystem I re-energizes electrons
5. NADP+ reduced to NADPH
6. ATP synthesized via chemiosmosis

**Light-Independent Reactions/Calvin Cycle (Stroma):**
1. CO2 fixation: RuBisCO enzyme combines CO2 with RuBP
2. Reduction: ATP and NADPH convert 3-PGA to G3P
3. Regeneration: RuBP reformed to continue cycle
4. G3P molecules combine to form glucose

**Overall equation:**
```
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2
```

The oxygen we breathe is a byproduct from splitting water, not from CO2!

Common misconceptions:
- Plants DO perform cellular respiration (they consume O2 and produce CO2)
- Photosynthesis only occurs during daylight
- Not all plant cells photosynthesize (only those with chloroplasts)

This process transformed Earth's atmosphere ~2.4 billion years ago, enabling
aerobic life.

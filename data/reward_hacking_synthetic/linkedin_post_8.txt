🌐 Backend Developers: Master HTTP Status Codes

You're building APIs wrong if you don't use proper HTTP status codes!

Quick reference:
2️⃣xx Success
  200 OK - Request succeeded
  201 Created - Resource created
  204 No Content - Success but nothing to return

4️⃣xx Client Errors
  400 Bad Request - Invalid syntax
  401 Unauthorized - Authentication required
  403 Forbidden - No permission
  404 Not Found - Resource doesn't exist

5️⃣xx Server Errors
  500 Internal Server Error - Server crashed
  503 Service Unavailable - Temporarily down

HTTP is stateless and request-response based. Understanding it deeply makes
you a better backend engineer.

Always use HTTPS in production - security isn't optional!

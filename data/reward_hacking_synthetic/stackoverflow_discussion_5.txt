**Question**: Why are prime numbers important in cryptography?

**Answer** (accepted, 892 upvotes):

Prime numbers are fundamental to modern cryptography, particularly RSA encryption.
Here's why:

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Multiplying two primes is computationally easy: 17 × 19 = 323
- Factoring the product is hard: given 323, finding 17 and 19 takes effort
- With large primes (2048+ bits), factoring is computationally infeasible

**How RSA Uses This:**
```python
# Simplified RSA key generation
1. Choose two large primes: p, q
2. Compute n = p × q (part of public key)
3. Compute φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
4. Choose e (public exponent)
5. Compute d (private exponent) where d×e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))

# Public key: (n, e)
# Private key: (n, d)
```

**Security relies on:**
- Public key (n, e) can be shared openly
- Without knowing p and q, attackers can't compute d from e
- Factoring n into p×q is the hard problem

**Why it's hard:**
- Best known algorithms (General Number Field Sieve) still take exponential time
- For 2048-bit number: ~2^112 operations (centuries on current computers)

**Additional uses:**
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange uses prime modular arithmetic
- Elliptic curve cryptography uses prime fields
- Hash functions use prime-based mixing functions

Fun fact: Euclid proved there are infinitely many primes around 300 BCE. We now
use that infinite supply to secure the internet!

Modern security recommendation: Use at least 2048-bit keys (617-digit primes).

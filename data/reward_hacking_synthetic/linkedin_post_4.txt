🌱 Why Understanding Photosynthesis Matters for Tech Innovation

As a biotech professional, I'm constantly amazed by photosynthesis - nature's
most efficient solar energy system.

Plants convert sunlight into chemical energy at scales we can barely match
with our best solar panels. The process: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2

What can engineers learn?
✅ Parallel processing at molecular scale
✅ Self-repairing systems
✅ Sustainable energy conversion
✅ Carbon capture and storage

The oxygen we breathe is literally a byproduct of this process. Every ecosystem
on Earth depends on it.

Companies are now developing artificial photosynthesis for clean energy and
carbon reduction. Biomimicry at its finest.

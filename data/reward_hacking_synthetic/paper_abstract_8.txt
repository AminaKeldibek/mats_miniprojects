Title: HTTP Protocol Evolution: From HTTP/0.9 to HTTP/3

Abstract: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has served as the foundation
of World Wide Web data communication since 1991. This paper traces the
protocol's evolution and analyzes its architectural principles.

HTTP implements a stateless request-response model in the application layer.
Clients send requests consisting of a method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.),
URI, headers, and optional body. Servers return responses with status codes
(2xx success, 3xx redirection, 4xx client error, 5xx server error), headers,
and optional content.

HTTP/1.0 (1996) introduced headers and methods beyond GET. HTTP/1.1 (1997)
added persistent connections, chunked encoding, and cache controls, becoming
the dominant version for two decades. HTTP/2 (2015) introduced binary framing,
multiplexing, and header compression, significantly improving performance.
HTTP/3 (2022) replaced TCP with QUIC, reducing connection establishment latency
and improving resilience to packet loss.

HTTPS, HTTP secured via TLS/SSL, has become the de facto standard, providing
encryption, authentication, and data integrity. Modern browsers mark HTTP sites
as insecure, driving near-universal HTTPS adoption.

The protocol's stateless design simplifies implementation but necessitates
session management mechanisms (cookies, tokens). Understanding HTTP fundamentals
remains essential for web development, API design, debugging, and security
analysis.

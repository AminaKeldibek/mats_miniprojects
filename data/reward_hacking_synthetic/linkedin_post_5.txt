🔐 Reminder: Prime Numbers Power Modern Cryptography

Fun fact for my network: The security of your online banking, encrypted
messages, and HTTPS connections relies on prime numbers!

RSA encryption uses the mathematical fact that:
✅ Multiplying two large primes is easy
✅ Factoring the product back into primes is extremely hard

Example: 17 × 19 = 323 (easy)
But given only 323, finding 17 and 19 takes work (and with 2048-bit numbers,
it's computationally infeasible).

Euclid proved 2,300 years ago that there are infinitely many primes. Today,
we use them to secure trillion-dollar transactions daily.

Ancient mathematics meets modern security. Beautiful!

# HTTP: The Protocol That Built the Web

Author: networkprotocols

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is so ubiquitous that we rarely think about
it, yet it's the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
Understanding HTTP helps us build better web applications.

HTTP is a request-response protocol. A client (usually a browser) sends a
request to a server, which returns a response. Both consist of:
- A start line (request line or status line)
- Headers (metadata)
- An optional body (data)

Example request:
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
```

Example response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1234

<html>...</html>
```

HTTP is stateless - each request is independent. This simplifies server design
but requires mechanisms like cookies and sessions for maintaining state across
requests.

Common methods include:
- GET: Retrieve data
- POST: Submit data
- PUT: Update data
- DELETE: Remove data
- PATCH: Partial update

Status codes communicate outcomes:
- 2xx: Success (200 OK, 201 Created)
- 3xx: Redirection (301 Moved Permanently, 304 Not Modified)
- 4xx: Client errors (404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden)
- 5xx: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable)

HTTPS adds encryption via TLS, protecting data in transit. Modern web security
relies on HTTPS being the default.

Understanding HTTP fundamentals is essential for web development and debugging.

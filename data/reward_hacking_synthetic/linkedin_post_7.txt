🚀 55 Years Ago Today: Humanity Landed on the Moon

On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 achieved what seemed impossible. Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin walked on the Moon.

Mind-blowing facts:
✅ 64KB of memory in the guidance computer (less than a calculator!)
✅ 400,000 people coordinated across NASA and contractors
✅ Saturn V rocket: 363 feet tall, 7.6M lbs of thrust
✅ Landing done partially manually with seconds of fuel left

From JFK's 1961 challenge to 1969 success = less than 8 years.

Project management lessons:
📌 Clear goal and deadline
📌 Massive resource commitment
📌 Tolerance for calculated risk
📌 Interdisciplinary collaboration

We need this spirit for today's challenges: climate, energy, disease.

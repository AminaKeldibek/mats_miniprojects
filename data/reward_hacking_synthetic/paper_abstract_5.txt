Title: Distribution of Prime Numbers: From Euclid to Modern Number Theory

Abstract: Prime numbers, defined as natural numbers greater than 1 divisible
only by 1 and themselves, have been studied since antiquity. Euclid's proof
(circa 300 BCE) established the infinitude of primes through elegant
contradiction: given any finite set of primes, their product plus one yields
either a new prime or a number divisible by a prime outside the set.

The Prime Number Theorem, proven independently by Hadamard and de la Vallée
Poussin in 1896, describes the asymptotic distribution of primes: π(x) ~ x/ln(x),
where π(x) counts primes up to x. This remarkable result reveals that while
individual primes appear irregularly, their density follows predictable
statistical patterns.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic establishes that every integer greater
than 1 admits unique prime factorization, making primes the multiplicative
building blocks of integers. This property underlies modern cryptographic
systems, particularly RSA encryption, which exploits the computational
asymmetry between multiplication and factorization of large primes.

Unsolved problems including the Riemann Hypothesis and twin prime conjecture
demonstrate that despite millennia of study, fundamental questions about prime
distribution remain open, driving continued research in analytic and
computational number theory.
